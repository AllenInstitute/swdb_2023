# Mouse visual system

For several decades, much of the work studying visual physiology was carried out in either primate or cat. This began with Hubel and Wiesel mapping receptive fields of "simple" and "complex" cells in the primary visual cortex of the cat. Recordings from neurons in other cortical areas in these animals have revealed neurons that respond to simple shapes, color, and motion - both direction selectivity as well as responses selective for more complex motion patters. Based both on these responses and on anatomical studies, there is thought to be two parallel streams, the "Dorsal" and "Ventral" streams. The dorsal stream is considered colloquially to be the "where" pathway, with many areas sensitive to motion, while the ventral stream is considered to be the "what" pathway, with neurons showing increased selectivity and invariance in their responses to objects and faces. Another way of framing these pathways is an "egocentric" and an "allocentric" pathway. 

## Cortical physiology

Starting in the early 2000s, researchers begans studying visual physiology and behavior in the mouse in earnest. Cris Niell used extracellular electrophysiology to record receptive fields of neurons in the mouse {term}'Primary visual cortex', finding receptive fields that looked very similar to those found in cat and primate {reference}. Many neurons showed orientation selectivity - selectively responding to gratings at a particular orientation - or direction selectivity - responding selectivity to gratings moving in a particular direction. Neurons also showed linear and non-linear summation that were the hallmarks of simple and complex cells. The key difference in these receptive fields is in their size. Mice have much poorer spatial resolution than primates and cats!

Using {term}'Two-photon calcium imaging' allowed large populations of neurons to be recorded across the cortex, and another key early result was that mouse (and rodents broadly) lack the orientation columns found in primates and cats. While the latter species have neurons that are tuned with similar orientations organized in columns, the rodent visual cortex has a "salt and pepper" organization, where the orientation selectively of neighboring neurons are randomly organized. {reference Ohki 2005}

Beyond {term}'V1' there are additional higher visual areas (or {term}'HVA's). These are cortical areas that exhibit <b>retinotopy</b> {Marina: can you unpack HVAs a bit here?}

An early question was whether neurons in different {term}'HVA's had distinct visual responses to subserve distinct functions. One framing of this question is whether there are streams akin to the dorsal and ventral streams in primate and cat? Early studies using {term}'Two-photon calcium imaging' compared the {term}'Spatial frequency' and {term}'Temporal frequency' tuning across several HVAs, finding evidence of functional differences between some of the areas. These results, alongside connectivity data, are suggestive that such a dorsal/ventral organization might be present - though with much more interconnection than found in primates/cats. {refs}
