Ephys
  Shorthand for electrophysiology.

GCaMP
  A family of fluorescent proteins that are engineered to luoresce when they are bound to calcium. GCaMP was generated by a fusion of the calcium binding domain of the calmodulin protein with green fluorescent protein ({term}`GFP`) [ADD CITATION]

HVA
  A <b>higher visual area</b> is a term for cortical visual areas that are not primary visual cortex, thought to be higher in the visual pathway. These include: VISl, VIsal, VISpm, VISam, VISrl among others

Neuropixels
  A family of devices for obtaining high channel count single unit extracellular recordings created through a collaborative open science project funded by Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Gatsby Charitable Trust, the Wellcome Trust, and the Allen Institute. These devices utilize modern integrated circuit design to miniaturize aspects of electrophysiology, enabling recordings of hundred of single units from a single probe with minimal brain damage. [ADD CITATION]

Ophys
  Shorthand for optical physiology, often in reference to {term}`Two-photon calcium imaging`.

Primary visual cortex
  The largest visual area in cortex that receives inputs from the Lateral geniculate nucleus of thalamus. Often refered to as <b>V1</b> or <b>VISp</b>.

ROI
  A <b>region of interest</b> that is identified in a two photon calcium imaging movie. This is a mask containing pixels thought to belong to a neuron.

Targeted structure
  The brain region where data was collected from.

Two-photon calcium imaging
  A term for techniques which measure neural activity of neurons by measuring a fluorescent calcium indicator. These indicators are usually a protein expressed in a cell, and in some cases are genetically encoded, such as {term}`GCaMP`. At rest a neuron has low levels of calcium, and when the neuron spikes calcium flows into the neuron and raises the level of calcium. [add details about two photon imaging. Add citation to a review]

V1
  V1 is another name for {term}`Primary visual cortex`
